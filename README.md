# SubQuery - Index stakers for the dApp Lucky in Shibuya/Shiden/Astar Networks

This project index: 
- all accounts staking in the dApp 'Lucky' in the context of dAppStaking module
- all developer rewards received by the dApp 'Lucky' in the context of dAppStaking module
- all pending rewards distributed by the dApp 'Lucky' 
- all claimed rewards distributed by the dApp 'Lucky' 

## Preparation

#### Environment

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) are required to compile project and define types.

- Both SubQuery CLI and generated Project have dependencies and require [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### Install 

Last, under the project directory, run following command to install all the dependency.

```
yarn install
```

## Configure your project

You will be mainly working on the following files:

- The Manifest in `project.yaml`
- The GraphQL Schema in `schema.graphql`
- The Mapping functions in `src/mappings/` directory

For more information on how to write the SubQuery,
check out our doc section on [Define the SubQuery](https://doc.subquery.network/define_a_subquery.html)

#### Code generation

In order to index your SubQuery project, it is mandatory to build your project first.
Run this command under the project directory.

```
yarn codegen
```

## Build the project

In order to deploy your SubQuery project to our hosted service, it is mandatory to pack your configuration before upload.
Run pack command from root directory of your project will automatically generate a `your-project-name.tgz` file.

```
yarn build
```

## Indexing and Query

#### Run required systems in docker

Under the project directory run following command:

```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

#### Query the project

Open your browser and head to `http://localhost:3000`.

Finally, you should see a GraphQL playground is showing in the explorer and the schemas that ready to query.


#### Query data comming from dAppStaking module

Query amount staked by account via the dAppStaking
```graphql
query {
  stakes{
    groupedAggregates(
      groupBy: [ACCOUNT_ID], 
      having: { sum: {amount: { notEqualTo: "0" }}}
    ) {
      sum{amount}, keys
    }
  }
}
```

Query amount staked by account for a given era
```graphql
query {
  stakes(filter: { era: { lessThanOrEqualTo: "2100" }}) {
    groupedAggregates(
      groupBy: [ACCOUNT_ID], 
      having: { sum: { amount: { notEqualTo: "0" }}}
    ) {
      sum{amount}, keys
    }
  }
}
```
or 
```graphql
query {
    accounts {
        nodes {
            id
            stakes {        
                groupedAggregates(
                    groupBy: [ACCOUNT_ID], 
                    having: { sum: { amount: { notEqualTo: "0" }}}
                ) {     
      		        sum{amount}
      	        }
            }
  	    }
    }   
}
```

Query the dApp's rewards
```graphql
query {
  developerRewards {
    aggregates {sum{amount}}
    nodes {amount, era}
  }
}
```

Query the dApp's rewards for a given era
```graphql
query {
  developerRewards(filter: { era: { equalTo: "2100" } }) {
    nodes {amount, era}
  }
}
```

Query the last dApp's rewards
```graphql
query {
  developerRewards(orderBy: ERA_DESC, first:1) {
    nodes {amount, era}
  }
}
```

Current era for the dApp Staking pallet
```graphql
query {
  palletInfos {
    nodes {
      currentEra
    }
  }
}
```

#### Query data comming from the dApp 'Lucky'  

Query the total stake and the rewards distributed by account
```graphql
query {  
  accounts{
    nodes{
      id, 
      totalStake, 
      totalRewards, 
      totalPending, 
      totalClaimed,
      rewards{nodes{era, amount}},
      rewardsClaimed{nodes{amount}}
    }    
  }
}
```



Query a specific account
```graphql
query {  
  accounts(filter : {id: {equalTo: "5C...hM"}}){
    nodes{
      id,
      totalStake, 
      totalRewards, 
      totalPending, 
      totalClaimed,
      rewards{nodes{era, amount}},
      rewardsClaimed{nodes{amount}}
    }  
  } 
}
```
